# JavaShapeandArrayDemo
Has 1 parent class shape, and 3 child classes circle, triangle, and rectangle. Also uses an array to store multiple shape objects and their corresponding data (height, width, radius etc.).  Finally, it prints out the total area of all the objects within the array. 

Old practice project, meant to demonstrate my understanding of Java, objects, classes, arrays, etc.
